# Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. 
R code is entered in blocks denoted by special symbols
and the text is displayed on the page.

This demonstration will create an html document with the results of 
the analysis of used tractor prices. 
This document can be viewed in any internet browser.

## Parameters

The header of the `qmd` file for this document 
declares several settings for the generation of the Quarto report.
The `format: html` option
and `toc: true` will generate a table of contents 
based on the headings in the document, 
complete with links to those sections. 

Other parameters relate to formatting and determine
what is rendered in the document.
The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code, 
so that only the output is displayed.
The `warning: false` option suppresses any warning messages, 
which are the analyst's business but would not appear in a presentation
(assuming the analysts has solved any related problems, of course).


# Analysis of Used Tractor Sales

## Preparing the Workspace

First, I loaded the required packages, 
for which it is not necessary to print output.


```{r}

# Load required libraries.
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# No need to set the working directory, 
# since it will automatically 
# use the files in the same folder.


```

## Initial Inspection of the Data

Then I read in all the data and joined it together, 
then generated new variables, all in one command.


```{r}


tractor_data <- read_xlsx("tractor_data.xlsx", sheet = "Sales") %>%
  left_join(read_xlsx("tractor_data.xlsx", sheet = "Specs")) %>%
  left_join(read_xlsx("tractor_data.xlsx", sheet = "Cabs")) %>%
  mutate(cab_orig = cab, 
         cab = ifelse(is.na(cab), 0, cab), 
         log_saleprice = log(saleprice), 
         squared_horsepower = horsepower^2)

# Inspect the contents one more time.
summary(tractor_data)
```


## Choosing the Dependent Variable

### Plotting the Variables

First, plot a histogram of the tractor prices, 
without any transformation. 
This time, I will use the `geom_histogram` function 
from the `ggplot2` graphics library in the tidyverse.

```{r}

ggplot(tractor_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(saleprice))

```

Notice that there are some very large values.
The distribution is highly skewed. 
Then, I considered taking logs to bring the outliers closer to the others.



```{r}
ggplot(tractor_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(log_saleprice))
```

This looks much better behaved: the distribution is nearly symmetric 
and it has a normal shape.
I would consider this as the dependent variable on these grounds alone.
However, we can estimate two models to gather more evidence for this decision.


### Comparison with Regression Models

The first regression model
is a linear model for dollar sale price.


```{r}

# Estimate a regression model.
lm_model_1 <- lm(data = tractor_data,
                 formula = saleprice ~ horsepower + age + enghours +
                   diesel + fwd + manual + johndeere +
                   cab +
                   spring + summer + winter)

# Output the results to screen.
summary(lm_model_1)
```

This model suggests that the premium for a John Deere
tractor is over $13,000, regardless of the type of tractor.
That seems implausible, given that most tractors cost only a
few thousand dollars.

The next regression model
is a linear model of the logarithm of the sale price.

```{r}
# Estimate a regression model.
lm_model_2 <- lm(data = tractor_data,
                 formula = log_saleprice ~ horsepower + age + enghours +
                   diesel + fwd + manual + johndeere +
                   cab +
                   spring + summer + winter)

# Output the results to screen.
summary(lm_model_2)
```


This model suggests that the premium for a John Deere
tractor is 30 percent above the value of a similar tractor of another brand.
This models makes much more sense, 
so we will use the logarithmic transformation of the sales price
as the dependent variable.
With this model, the coefficients are interpreted as 
percentage changes in the value of tractors.
Also, the R-squared is higher, even though it is not a direct comparison, 
since the dependent variable is different. 
Still, this model looks more promising.



## Nonlinear Specification of Horsepower

Consider a polynomial functional form for horsepower.
The idea, suggested by a tractor dealer, 
is that horsepower improves performance up to a limit,
then the extra power does not add much value, 
but still consumes more fuel, so it is more expensive to operate.

If this theory is true, we expect that
the coefficient for `horsepower` is positive
and that the coefficient for `squared_horsepower` is negative. 
These are the results:

```{r}
# Estimate a regression model.
lm_model_3 <- lm(data = tractor_data,
                 formula = log_saleprice ~ horsepower + squared_horsepower + 
                   age + enghours +
                   diesel + fwd + manual + johndeere +
                   cab +
                   spring + summer + winter)

# Output the results to screen.
summary(lm_model_3)
```

Both coefficients are significant and the signs are as expected, 
which supports the theory of the polynomial form for the value of horsepower.


## Seasonal Indicators

Since the seasonal indicators do not appear to be significant, 
estimate the model without those indicators.


```{r}
# Estimate a regression model.
lm_model_3 <- lm(data = tractor_data,
                 formula = log_saleprice ~ horsepower + squared_horsepower + 
                   age + enghours +
                   diesel + fwd + manual + johndeere +
                   cab # +
                   # spring + summer + winter
                   )

# Output the results to screen.
summary(lm_model_3)
```

This is a better model, 
as the R-squared is actually higher without these variables.
More importantly, all the coefficients in this model are significant. 
Therefore, this is the model I recommend for predicting the prices of used tractors. 

## Conclusions

With this model, we see that the value of a tractor 
has a polynomial relationship with horsepower:
the value increases to a point, then declines as 
tractors with higher horsepower are more expensive to operate.

The values of tractors decline as they age, 
losing about 3 percent of value each year. 
The value of tractors also declines with more use, 
declining about 4 percent for every thousand hours of use.

In terms of the features of the tractores, 
those that run on diesel fuel ar worth about 20 percent more than 
a similar tractor that runs on gasoline. 
A four-wheel drivetrain adds about 26 percent to the value of a tractor.
A tractor with manual transmission is worth about 15 percent less
than a similar one with a manual transmission. 
A tractor with a cab is worth about 48 percent more than a similar
tractor without a cab. 



Finally, a John Deere tractor is worth about 32 percent more than a similar tractor of another brand.
